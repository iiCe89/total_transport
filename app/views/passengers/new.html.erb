    <h2>Direct transport for rural Essex</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Pickup, a new rural transport service sponsored by Essex County Council. It’s cheaper than a taxi, more flexible than a bus, and goes exactly where you want to go.</p>
    <!-- <p>Instead of running fixed routes with fixed stops, Pickup lets you book trips in advance. Passengers can be picked up anywhere they like - a bus stop, a local place of interest, or even a home. It's safe, convenient and easy to use.</p> -->

    <%= form_for @passenger, url: passenger_path do |form| %>
      <%= form.label :phone_number, "Get started with your mobile number" %>
      <%= form.number_field :phone_number, autofocus: true, :pattern => "\\d*", :step => "0" %>
      <div class="actions">
        <%= form.submit "Verify Number", class: 'alt-button' %>
